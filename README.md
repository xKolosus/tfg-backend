# tfg-backend
This was the project I had to present with my first interaction with Spring Boot, so there may be some issues, nowadays I won't work that much direcly with the entity,
mostly with a POJO, VO, DTO as you prefer to call it.

Neither I would leave the testing undone, and more of the parts I would've loved to improve as OAuth2 instead of simply JWT.

Basically was a project to take similarity with any kind of blog with a database and profile user personalization.

Thanks for having a look, any advice or new technology to be used is good to know, feel free to bring ideas.
